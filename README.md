# Thesis VR Project | Exploring an Accurated Depiction of the Local Solar System.
 
*This project was made as part of the completion of a [Master of Arts in Learning and Technology](https://www.royalroads.ca/programs/master-arts-learning-and-technology) from [Royal Roads University](https://www.royalroads.ca/) in Canada.*

## Limitations of Source Code
Sadly, this project use a few third-party applications to enable the experience. Most notably:

 - [Space Graphics Toolkit](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/level-design/space-graphics-toolkit-4160) by Carlos Wilkes
 - [Lo-Fi Atmospheres Music Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/electronic/lo-fi-atmospheres-music-pack-162112) by Steven Melin

As such, only code that I wrote will be included in this repository to protect and honor the hard work of these individuals.

## Goals
This program aimed to test the idea of presence in a learning-based activity using fully immersed virtual reality headsets. Long term, the purpose would be to create a standard of best practices for teaching in virtual environments, interconnecting pedagogy, technology, and a learning specification.
